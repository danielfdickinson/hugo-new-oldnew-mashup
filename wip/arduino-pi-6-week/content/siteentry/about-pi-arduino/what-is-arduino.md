# What is the Arduino Uno?

  * A microcontroller plus support electronics for allowing programmatic control of both digital and analog electronic devices
  * The microcontroller and onboard flash (and RAM) allows the Arduino to run software to control hardware (aka firmware), but does not have enough resources to run most operating systems (including Linux)
  * As a consequence it generally operates a single program (called a sketch) at a time
  * It, however, can interface with a more powerful computer (including the Raspberry Pi) which can control what sketches run and when on the Arduino, and/or receive or send data from or to the Arduino for advanced processing and behaviours.
  * The device comes preloaded with a number of 'libraries' and an interpreter for the "Processing" programming language, to make programming easier
  * OpenSource: the design of the Arduino is fully available so anyone can build their own Arduino, or modify and build a modified version (and share the results)
  * This: (Show &amp; Tell)
