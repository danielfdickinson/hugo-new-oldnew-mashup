# What is the Raspberry Pi?

  * A full-blown computer capable of running a desktop
  * Based on a different processor (brains) than a typical laptop or desktop
  * Is performant enough to be useful, but lower performance than a typical desktop, laptop, or high-end mobile device (expensive cell phones, tablets, etc)
  * Designed to make it easy to use with electronics projects
  * Created by a U.K. non-profit to make it easy and inexpensive to learn computing and electronics and especially the combination of those (including robotics) using a general purpose computer (i.e. not only for robotics and electronics)
  * This! (Show & Tell)
