Screenshot of an old version of The CShore Website Homepage which is
various shades of blue, with a header row which has a site badge on the
left and text 'buttons' with links to site sections.  This homepage
contains a large dark blue serif font on a light blue background with
the title of the site.  Below that is a middle blue box with cyan text
with a one-liner and blurb about the the site.  In the middle of the
page is a catchy phrase with a footnote.  Below that are two
screenshots, slightly rotated, one of an older version of the website,
and the other of cshoredaniel (Daniel Dickinson)'s GitHub profile.  The
bottom of the screen is missing from the screenshot.  The background is
a very pale blue with an ASCII smiley face watermark
