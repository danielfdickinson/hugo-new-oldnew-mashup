# Privacy / GDPR Statement

## When located at primary location

The following statements apply to this site when hosted at
[https://hugo-oldnew-mashup.thecshore.com](https://hugo-oldnew-mashup.thecshore.com)

## No Cookies

This site does not use cookies for any purpose.

## Server IP Logging

This site temporarily (for about two week) logs the IP address and associated
User-Agent Strings and URLS connecting to this server.  These logs are used for
security and rough analytics (# of users connecting, approximate device, approximate average lengths of visit, errors generated, and similar information).  No personally identifying information is gathered during the visit, and the logs are rotated on a two week cycle (so the logs will no longer be present after two weeks).  The aggregate data gathered from the logs is kept for some years, however.

## No cloud-connected analytics

This site does not use any analytics from services such as Google, Facebook, or
other 'cloud'-based analytics offerings.  At the present time the site do not
gather analytics beyond the site logs, either and will add a news item and the
information here if this changes.

## Third Party Tools -- Hosted Locally, No Known Analytics, But...

This site uses some third party CSS and Javascript code which is hosted directly
on this site (so no analytics result from CDN access, for example), however it
is difficult to guarantee that there no analytics embedded within the code this
site uses from third parties.  The site site operator is not aware of
analytics being used by that software, but does not provide a guarantee that is
the case.  As always use cookie and tracker blocking (such as Privacy Badger
for Firefox).

## GDPR

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a law that governs privacy for
the EU (European Union).  To the best of the site operator's knowledge this site
complies with that regulation, even though as a Canadian owned and operated
site it does not need to do so.
