# Privacy / GDPR Statement

## Hosted on Netlify

This theme is now hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  See the
[Netlify Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) and
[Netlify GDPR Statement](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr/) for the most of
the details that apply to this site.

## Site-specific Policy / Statement

### No Cookies

This site does not use cookies for any purpose. (Unless Netlify does).

### We don't add cloud-connected analytics

This site does not use any analytics from services such as Google,
Facebook, or other 'cloud'-based analytics offerings.  Obviously
Netlfiy's analytics are in play, however.

### Offsite Images and Other Offsite Content

This site hosts all content required for serving the pages and images
on this on site locally.  That is your browser does not, nor does this
site, make requests for offsite content in order for you to view this
site.  There was a period where this site inadvertently included image
links to various badges and status notifications related to the code.
Those have been moved to the README.md which is only displayed via the
Git hosting service and does not appear on this site.

### Search Function Is Purely Local

The search function in the menu bar does not require access to any third
party sites (i.e. no Google or other search engines) and uses a local
index and local Javascript to perform the search and display the
results.  Unforunately it doesn't work with IE11.
