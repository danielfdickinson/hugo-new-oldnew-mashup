A screen shot of a recent version of The C Shore About Page.  It
consists of a a header row which has a site badge on the left and text
'buttons' with links to site sections on the right. The rest of the page
is in two columns of text, the leftmost being much larger.  The top of
this larger section has a large title 'About The C Shore' with ridged
borders above and below.  In the main text area is a headshot of Daniel
Dickinson, then a series of paragraphs.  The smaller right side column
contains a navigation menu, 'News', and 'Recent Changes' section with
titles and summaries from various pages on The C Shore.
