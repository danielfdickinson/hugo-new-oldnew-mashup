Photo with a hazy sky at the top, with a hill of trees with autumn
(colourful) leaves.  Below that is a grain elevator with a large outdoor
mural depicting the meeting of European colonials and indigenous
inhabitants of the region.  At the bottom (which is the foreground),
are closer autumn (colourful) trees and hydro poles and wires.  On the
