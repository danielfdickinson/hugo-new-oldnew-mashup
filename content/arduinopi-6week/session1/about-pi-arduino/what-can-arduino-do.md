# What Can You Do With The Arduino Uno?

## With additional electronics

  * Respond to sensors in complicated ways (e.g. detect patterns of light flashes and respond appropriately, temperature variations (or straight temp), temp + time (with the addition of an RTC), patterns of vibrations, etc)
  * Control motors/servos/actuators/relays; especially useful for robotics, or building custom CNC devices
  * Interface with a Pi so that Arduino handles the heavy-duty electronics, while the Pi handles higher-level logic
  * Capture and log environmental data
  * Be part of an alarm system, controlling and preprocessing IR, ultrasonic, sound, etc sensors
  * Much more...
