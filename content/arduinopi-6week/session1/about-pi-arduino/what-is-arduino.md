# What is the Arduino Uno?

  * A microcontroller (cpu with minimal ram and flash) plus support electronics to
     allow writing software (sketches) to control electronic devices
     (digital or analog; see 
     [Just Enough Electronics](../blinky-lights/jeel/) slide for details).
  * Does not have enough resources to run most operating systems (including Linux)
  * As a consequence it generally operates a single program (called
    a sketch) at a time
  * It can interface with a more powerful computer (including
    the Raspberry Pi) which can control what sketches run and when on the
    Arduino, and/or receive or send data from or to the Arduino for
    advanced processing and behaviours.
  * The device comes preloaded with a bootloader that makes it easy to program with sketches
  * The makers of the Arduino provide a number of standard libraries and tools
    to make using the Arduino easier.
  * OpenSource: the design of the Arduino is fully available so anyone can
    build their own Arduino, or modify and build a modified version
    (and share the results)
  * This: (Show &amp; Tell)
